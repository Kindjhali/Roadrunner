# Actionable Tasks for Roadrunner Standalone

This file lists actionable tasks for the Roadrunner standalone application, based on the "Areas for Future Development" section in the `README.md`.

## Tasks

1.  **Improve autonomous decision-making by the LLM:**
    *   Explore new prompting techniques to enhance the LLM's ability to understand and execute tasks.
    *   Investigate integration with more advanced LLM APIs or models that offer better reasoning capabilities.
    *   Develop a framework for the LLM to request clarification or ask for help when it encounters ambiguity.

2.  **Support complex Git workflows:**
    *   Implement support for creating and switching branches.
    *   Add functionality for merging branches and resolving merge conflicts.
    *   Explore options for rebasing and other advanced Git operations.

3.  **Enhance UI for specific step types and confirmation handling:**
    *   Design and implement custom UI elements for different step types (e.g., file editing, Git operations) to provide a more intuitive user experience.
    *   Improve the way confirmation prompts are displayed to the user, making them clearer and easier to understand.
    *   Allow users to view and manage the history of confirmations for a task.

4.  **Implement robust error recovery:**
    *   Develop a system for automatic retries when transient errors occur.
    *   Allow users to manually intervene when an error occurs, providing options to skip the failed step, retry it, or modify the task parameters.
    *   Improve error reporting to provide more detailed and actionable information to the user.

5.  **Allow user-configurable settings:**
    *   Create a settings panel where users can configure LLM providers and API keys.
    *   Allow users to customize default behaviors, such as the safety mode or the level of detail in logs.
    *   Store user settings persistently so they don't have to be reconfigured every time the application is launched.

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. Improve Autonomous Decision-Making by the LLM

*   **Objective:** Enhance the LLM's ability to make decisions and execute tasks autonomously.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   Research and implement advanced prompting techniques (e.g., ReAct, Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts) to improve LLM reasoning and planning.
    *   Evaluate and integrate newer LLM models or APIs that demonstrate superior capabilities in autonomous task execution.
    *   Develop a feedback loop where the LLM can learn from past mistakes or successful task completions.
    *   Implement a mechanism for the LLM to decompose complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
    *   Allow the LLM to request clarification or additional information when faced with ambiguity.

### 2. Support Complex Git Workflows

*   **Objective:** Extend Roadrunner's Git capabilities to handle more complex scenarios.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   Implement functionality for creating, deleting, and switching between Git branches.
    *   Add support for merging branches, including handling merge conflicts (potentially with LLM assistance).
    *   Investigate and implement options for Git rebase operations.
    *   Allow users to view Git history and compare changes between commits.
    *   Provide a way to manage Git remotes and configure authentication.

### 3. Enhance UI for Specific Step Types and Confirmation Handling

*   **Objective:** Improve the user interface to provide a more intuitive and informative experience.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   Design and implement custom UI components for different step types (e.g., a dedicated file editor, a visual Git branch manager).
    *   Improve the clarity and usability of confirmation prompts, providing users with more context and control.
    *   Develop a system for managing the history of confirmations and approvals for a task.
    *   Enhance the display of task progress and logs, making it easier for users to understand what Roadrunner is doing.
    *   Explore options for visualizing task plans and execution flows.

### 4. Implement Robust Error Recovery

*   **Objective:** Make Roadrunner more resilient to errors and provide better options for handling them.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   Implement a system for automatic retries for transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary file locks).
    *   Allow users to define error handling strategies for specific steps or tasks (e.g., skip step, retry with different parameters, halt task).
    *   Provide users with clear and actionable error messages, including suggestions for resolving the issue.
    *   Develop a mechanism for users to manually intervene when an error occurs, allowing them to modify task parameters or take corrective actions.
    *   Implement a "safe mode" or "dry run" feature that allows users to test tasks without making actual changes to the system.

### 5. Allow User-Configurable Settings

*   **Objective:** Provide users with more control over Roadrunner's behavior and configuration.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   Develop a settings panel or configuration file where users can manage LLM provider preferences, API keys, and model choices.
    *   Allow users to customize default behaviors, such as safety mode settings, logging levels, and workspace locations.
    *   Implement a system for managing different user profiles or configurations.
    *   Ensure that user settings are stored securely and persistently.
    *   Provide options for importing and exporting user configurations.
