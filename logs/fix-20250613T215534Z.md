## roadrunner.js
- **Location:** `registerAgentResponse` function
- **Issue:** Confidence values were stored without validation, leading to potential NaN or out-of-range values during evaluation.
- **Change:** Added sanitization of the `confidence` parameter to ensure a numeric value between 0 and 1 is recorded.
- **Verification:** Basic `node example_agents.js` run confirms no errors when passing invalid confidence values.
